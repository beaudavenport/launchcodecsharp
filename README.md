This is the repository for my web application developed for Launchcode's C#
class.  The application is called STL Tap Report, and is an online database
and educational site about craft beer in the St. Louis area.  It was developed
in Visual Studio 2013 using the ASP.NET MVC 4 framework for content and Entity
Framework for database queries.
